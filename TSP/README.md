# Travelling Salesman Problem

1) The tsp.py file generates random points corresponding to cities and tries to find the shortest
path that goes through all the cities such that each city is visited only once.
2) We solve this problem using A* Search along with the MST Heuristic.
3) A graph depicting Number of Cities vs. Time to Solve TSP is plotted to see how time to solve TSP
is affected with increase in Number of Cities
